Project 5: Hackathon

We chose to look at the restaurant dataset, which was provided by the company in hopes of data science feedback on where to open new restaurants.  Our goal was to create a regression model, based on the predictive variables provided, to adequately predict the revenue of each restaurant.  

The datasets came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction/data).  The dataset we did our modeling on had 137 rows and 43 columns, including the target.  The validation set provided had 100,000 rows and 42 columns, not including the target.
